## Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The developed inventory app for Mobile2App Company aims to address the needs of effectively managing warehouse items. The app's requirements and goals include:

1. **Database:** The app includes a database with two tables - one for inventory items and another for user logins and passwords.

2. **User Authentication:** The app provides a login screen for users to access their accounts. It also allows new users to create accounts.

3. **Inventory Display:** The app features a screen displaying all items in the warehouse, presented in a grid format. This enables users to quickly review the available inventory.

4. **Adding and Removing Items:** The app enables users to add new items to the inventory and remove existing ones. This supports efficient inventory management.

5. **Quantity Adjustment:** Users can increase or decrease the quantity of specific items in the inventory. This ensures accurate tracking of item levels.

6. **Low Inventory Notification:** The app is designed to notify users when the quantity of any item in the inventory reaches zero. This helps prevent stockouts and aids in timely restocking.

In summary, this app is designed to meet the needs of warehouse management by offering an organized and user-friendly platform for tracking inventory items. It addresses the challenges of maintaining inventory levels, preventing stockouts, and ensuring accurate quantity management.

## What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The inventory app's development revolved around meeting users' needs through a carefully designed user interface. This interface comprised several key screens and features, all geared towards streamlining inventory management while providing an intuitive and user-centric experience.

Central to this approach was the login and registration screen, accommodating both new and existing users. By offering clear fields for credentials and account creation, the onboarding process became efficient, reducing friction and encouraging user engagement. The inventory overview screen displayed items in a grid layout, presenting vital information like names and quantities in an organized manner. This design expedited decision-making, enabling users to swiftly assess their inventory. Additionally, tapping on specific items revealed detailed screens, delivering comprehensive attributes and streamlining the decision-making process further.

Another screen facilitated the addition and removal of items via an intuitive form with clear controls. Error messages and validations maintained user accuracy. Adjusting item quantities used straightforward "+" and "-" buttons. Lastly, the app proactively alerted users when items hit zero quantities, fostering timely replenishment. Throughout these designs, user-centric principles, clear visual cues, consistent elements, and intuitive interactions coalesced to create an efficient, effective, and user-friendly inventory management tool.
